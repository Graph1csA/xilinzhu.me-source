I'm a computer science Ph.D. student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://wpi.edu) and a member of [TheCakeLab](https://cake.wpi.edu).
My current research interests focus on the algorithm and system designs for novel Augmented Reality (AR) systems.
Specifically, I have recently worked on several projects on improving the environment lighting estimation accuracy and runtime performance for mobile AR.

Examples of the research questions and challenges I have worked on: single/multi-view lighting estimation, 3D vision, computer graphics, real-time system performance optimization, edge-assisted deep inference support and information theory.

Check out my research project details [here](/project/).

*I'm generally interested in developing novel systems for future AR and HCI. If you are in interested in collaboration, [shoot me an email](mailto:yiqinzhao@outlook.com)!*

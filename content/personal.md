In my spare time, I enjoy being in the nature, road tripping, and work on my [website templates](https://github.com/YiqinZhao/yiqinzhao.me-source).
I have made two cross-country (U.S.) road trips, here is all the states I have visited (marked in green).

I love long-range driving because I genuinely feel relaxed during the time, and I enjoy driving across beautiful landscapes.
One of most beautiful scene I have every seen is a phoenix-like cloud on top of the Phoenix city when I drove by in 2022.
What a beautiful coincidence!

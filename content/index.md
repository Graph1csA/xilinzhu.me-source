## ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

üîä *My name pounces as: Yi-Chin*

I am a fourth-year Computer Science M.S./Ph.D. candidate at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://wpi.edu) and a proud member of [The Cake Lab](https://cake-lab.github.io) research group.
I feel extremely fortunate to be advised by my kind and wise advisor [Prof. Tian Guo](https://tianguo.info).
I am interested in designing system supports and optimizations for Augmented Reality (AR) applications.
My recent research has a strong focus on designing system support for AR environment lighting understanding and photorealistic rendering.

In the past, I have interned at [Baidu](https://baidu.com) (Summer 2018), [Kuaishou Y-tech Graphics AI team](http://www.chongyangma.com/team/index.html) in Spring 2022, and [GoogleARVR](https://arvr.google.com) in Summer/Fall 2022.
In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, road tripping, and work on my [website templates](https://github.com/YiqinZhao/yiqinzhao.me-source).

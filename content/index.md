# ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

üîä *My name pounces as: Yi-Chin*

ü™ß **I'm currently interning at GoogleARVR for the 2022 summer, hosted by [Sean Fanello](https://www.seanfanello.it).**

I am a third-year Computer Science M.S./Ph.D. student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://wpi.edu) and a proud member of [The Cake Lab](https://cake-lab.github.io) research group.
I feel extremely fortunate to be advised by my kind and wise advisor [Prof. Tian Guo](https://tianguo.info).
I'm interested in designing system supports and optimizations for Augmented Reality (AR) applications.
My recent research has a strong focus on designing system support for AR environment lighting understanding and photorealistic rendering.

Prior to WPI, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Tianjin Normal University (TJNU)](https://tjnu.edu.cn), Tianjin, China in 2019.
During my undergraduate study, I worked with [Prof. Ziping Zhao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ziping-Zhao-2) on audio signal processing, speech emotion recognition, and affective computing.
I was also a software engineer intern at [Baidu](https://baidu.com) during the summer time in 2018.
In spring 2022, I interned in the [Y-tech Graphics AI team](http://www.chongyangma.com/team/index.html) at [Kuaishou](https://www.kuaishou.com/en), mentored by [Haibin Huang](https://brotherhuang.github.io) and [Chongyang Ma](http://www.chongyangma.com).
<!-- Apart from my research, I love cooking and playing guitar (check my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yiqinzhao1996)).

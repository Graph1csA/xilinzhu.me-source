## ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

üîä *My name pounces as: Yi-Chin*

I am a fifth-year Computer Science M.S./Ph.D. candidate at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://wpi.edu) and a proud member of [The Cake Lab](https://cake-lab.github.io) research group.
I feel extremely fortunate to be advised by my kind and wise advisor [Prof. Tian Guo](https://tianguo.info).

My research interest lies in ubiquitous computing, augmented reality, and computer vision.
My recent research projects have a strong focus on improving photorealism in mobile AR by developing novel environment lighting sensing systems.
The insights of my research are mainly derived from the investigation of mobile device dynamics, physical modeling of spatial transformations, and data-driven studies.
In the past, I have designed machine learning models and real-time systems for mobile AR environment lighting estimation.
I‚Äôm also interested in security and privacy issues associated with photorealism in AR.

In the past, I have interned at [Google AR&VR](https://arvr.google.com), [Kuaishou Y-tech Graphics AI team](http://www.chongyangma.com/team/index.html), [Baidu](https://baidu.com).
In my spare time, I enjoy being in the nature, road tripping, and work on my [website templates](https://github.com/YiqinZhao/yiqinzhao.me-source).

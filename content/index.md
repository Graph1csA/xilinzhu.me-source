## About Me

My name is Xilin Zhu. I am an incoming Ph.D student at Rochester Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Yiqin Zhao](https://yiqinzhao.phd).
Currently, I am a Research Assistant at Nanjing University in Prof. Beibei Wang's lab.

I am interested in Computer Graphics and Generative Models.
Specifically, my current research focuses on exploring how generative models could facilitate 3D reconstruction tasks.
<!-- I am an assistant professor at [Rochester Insitute of Technology (RIT)](https://rit.edu).
I received my Ph.D. from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://wpi.edu) in August 2025.
During my Ph.D. study, I have worked on AR environment sensing and perception systems, context-aware generative AI systems, privacy-preserving AI content generation, and infrastructure projects for AR experimentation.
My current research focuses on building AI models and system support for real-world applications in dynamic contexts, with a special emphasis on enabling the seamless integration between virtual contents and the physical world.
In the past, I also had the fortunate to work with many awesome industry researchers at Adobe Research, Google AR&VR, Kuaishou Y-tech Graphics AI team, and Baidu. -->

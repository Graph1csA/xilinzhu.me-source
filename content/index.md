## ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

I am a final-year Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://wpi.edu) and a proud member of [The Cake Lab](https://cake-lab.github.io) research group.
I feel extremely fortunate to be advised by my kind and wise advisor [Prof. Tian Guo](https://tianguo.info).


My research includes building AI models and AI system supports for dynamic application scenarios.
In particular, my research pays special interest in exploring the emerging area of immersive computing.
Specifically, my works aim to safely and robustly blend computing into physical environments.
My work explores problems and solutions that allow mobile computing systems to adapt to the complex dynamics of key mobile computing stakeholders‚Äìuser, device, environment, and AI system.
Centered around this objective, I have worked on environment sensing and perception systems, context-aware generative AI systems, privacy-preserving AI content generation, and infrastructure projects for AR experimentation.


In the past, I had the fortunate to work with and study from many awesome industry researchers during my time at Adobe Research, Google AR&VR, Kuaishou Y-tech Graphics AI team, and Baidu.
<!-- In my spare time, I enjoy being in the nature, road tripping, and work on my [website templates](https://github.com/YiqinZhao/yiqinzhao.me-source). -->
